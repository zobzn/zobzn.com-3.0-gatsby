A little bird told me...
Ain't nothing gonna happen to you.
All I ask in return is your cooperation.
All I wanted to do was get home.
All in all, I'm pretty damn happy.
All in all, can't complain.
All in all, everything is better than we can hope for.
All in all, it was a great vacation.
All kidding aside.
All right, I'll do it.
All right, let's do it.
All right, let's do this.
All work and no play.
All you have to do is go home.
All you have to do is sit there and be quiet.
All you have to do is tell the truth.
Am I explaining this clearly?
Am I missing something?
Am I right?
Am I the only one feeling a connection here?
Am I the only one seeing this?
Am I the only one taking this seriously?
Am I the only one who remembers that?
Am I the only one who thinks this is insane?
Am I the only one who's terrified?
Anything for you, name it.
Are we on the same page here?
Are we on the same page?
Are we understanding each other?
Are you OK? You seem to be distracted.
Are you all right?
Are you done with that?
Are you for real?
Are you getting along with your new colleague?
Are you gonna be okay?
Are you in the mood for an apology?
Are you in the mood for some pizza?
Are you insane?
Are you kidding me?
Are you looking for something?
Are you nuts?
Are you ready?
Are you sure?
Are you telling me that...?
Are you trying to be clever?
Are you up for a beer tonight?
Are you up for it?
Aren't you gonna be late for work?
Aren't you supposed to be on vacation?
Aren't you supposed to be...?
As a matter of fact, ...
As far as I know, ...
As far as I'm concerned, there's nothing else to talk about.
As for me, I was just happy to get some rest.
As has been proven recently, ...
As you have probably guessed, I am a man of science.
As you might have guessed, I am a man of science.
At first I was a little disappointed.
Brace yourself.
By any chance...
By the looks of it, the answer's pretty clear.
By the way, did you know that...
By the way, have you heard about...
By way of an apology, please accept this little present.
By way of introduction, allow me to say this...
Calm down.
Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you something?
Can I borrow your car?
Can I count on you?
Can I get you anything?
Can I have a rain check?
Can I just stop you there for a moment?
Can I say something on my behalf?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can I talk to you outside?
Can I tell you something?
Can we get back to work?
Can we just cut to the chase?
Can we just forget it ever happened?
Can you at least tell me what went wrong?
Can you believe it?
Can you do me a favor?
Can you fill me in?
Can you give me a minute?
Can you jot it down?
Can you pass me the salt please?
Can't complain.
Chances are, we'll never know.
Come on. Let's get this over with.
Come to think of it, ...
Congratulations on passing your exams.
Congratulations on your new job.
Consider it a wedding present.
Could I talk to you for a minute?
Could you do me a favor?
Could you let me know if you can...
Could you tell me ...?
Cut it out!
Did I do something wrong?
Did I mention that this story has a happy ending?
Did I miss anything?
Did I miss something?
Did I say something wrong?
Did I tell you about …?
Did I tell you what happened last night?
Did it ever occur to you that I might have other plans?
Did it ever occur to you to help me out?
Did you ever solve that Rubik's cube?
Did you get to see a doctor?
Did you get to...?
Did you hear that?
Did you just change your mind?
Did you know I'm utterly insane?
Did you need me for something?
Did you think I was kidding?
Did you think I wouldn't find out what you did?
Ditto.
Do I make myself clear?
Do what you will.
Do with it what you will.
Do you get along with Kenji? We're on good terms.
Do you have a minute? Sure, what is it?
Do you have a second? Sure, what is it?
Do you have any idea what's happening here?
Do you have any weekend plans?
Do you know how long it took me to prepare this?
Do you mind if I carry on working?
Do you mind if I join you?
Do you mind if I say something?
Do you mind if I take a rain check?
Do you mind if I take off?
Do you mind if I tell you something?
Do you wanna come in for a drink?
Do you wanna come in for a second?
Do you want tee or coffee? I'll go with coffee.

Does it have something to do with me?
Does that sound like something you'd be interested in?

I ain't got no money.
I ain't got no time for this.
I always get by, this way or that — Я всегда справляюсь, так или иначе.
I am in your debt.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the batteries that are not included.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the bubble gum that sticks in you hair.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the itch you cannot reach.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the little mouse that eats your cheese.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the onion that stings in your eyes.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the skunk that pollutes your air.
I am the terror that flaps in the night. I am the yoyo that keeps coming back or something.
I appreciate that.
I appreciate your concern.
I ask for so little.
I call the shots around here
I came by because I know I didn't do so great yesterday.
I came by because I want to talk to you about something.
I came by for a cup of coffee.
I came by to tell you it won't happen again.

I can't tell you how many times I've asked myself that same question.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate everything you're doing for me.
I can't tell you how...
I can't thank you enough.
I can't think of anything to say that hasn't already been said.
I can't wait to get some food in my mouth.
I can't wait to try it.
I changed my mind. (я передумал когда-то)
I come and go as I please.
I could have been...
I could never do that.
I could never...
I couldn't agree more.
I couldn't care less.

I'm ravenous! When do we dine?
I'm really sorry that I forgot to send you a birthday card but I was busy with my new job.
I'm right here, just in case.
I'm running late.
I'm short on cash.
I'm sick of being told what to do.
I'm so flattered.
I'm so happy for you.
I'm so proud of you.
I'm sorry I haven't been in touch for such a long time.
I'm sorry I haven't written for such a long time.
I'm sorry I snapped at you.
I'm sorry I was short with you the other day.
I'm sorry if I've been such a burden.
I'm sorry it didn't work out.
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'm starving. When do we dine?
I'm swamped with work.
I'm the last to know.
I'm trying to get a job.
I'm trying to keep up with you.
I'm used to it.
I'm wondering...
I'm worn out. Exhausted.
I've already embarrassed you enough.
I've been a very bad boy. Spank me.
I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong.
I've been doing this for six hours.
I've been down this road before.
I've been here for over an hour.
I've been looking all over for you.
I've been looking for...
I've been looking forward to this day for months.
I've been looking over your resume...
I've been meaning to tell you...
I've been meaning to thank you for...
I've been meaning to...
I've been practicing a lot, I swear.
I've been practicing like crazy.
I've been relaxing here, doing nothing.
I've been stuck here all day.
I've been talking about myself all night long.
I've been there a million times and no one's offered me an audition.
I've been thinking about...
I've been told...
I've been trying to picture my life without you.
I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
I've been waiting for...
I've been working all day to...
I've been working on it all week.
I've been working on this joke for over a week.
I've been working really hard lately.
I've changed my mind. (я передумал сейчас)
I've decided to accept the job.
I've decided to change my bad habits.
I've decided to opt for sanity.
I've got a bad feeling about ...
I've got a bunch of interviews today.
I've got a lot of work to do.
I've got it covered.
I've got some errands to run.
I've got some errands, I've got to run.
I've got such good news. It's gonna blow your mind.
I've got to run.
I've got writer's block.
I've got...
I've had enough.
I've had it up to here.
I've heard many good things about you.
I've heard the story a thousand times.
I've heard this story once or twice.
I've never been much of a talker.
I've never been so nervous.
I've never seen you smile.
I've never seen you smoke.
I've never understood the difference.
I've no doubt you'll regret the whole business in a few days.
I've spent enough time on that for one day.
I've spent enough time on this nonsense.
I've spent far too many hours at the office.
I've spent weeks on this.
I've wondered
If I had known, I would have told you.
If I had stayed in the country I would have been gardening yesterday.
If I hadn't spent all my money I would buy a new laptop next month.
If I recall, you had a list of reasons.
If I remember correctly, ...
If I were you, I wouldn't ask.
If I were you, I'd do the same.
If I were you, I'd take it seriously.
If I were you, I'd wait and see.
If I weren't allergic I would have tried it.
If I would have known, I would have told you.
If I'm harsh with you, it is only because you're doing it wrong.
If I'm honest, I like to walk on my own.
If I'm not mistaken, ...
If all goes well, I'll soon be able to afford a house.
If all goes well, you won't regret it
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
If it helps I...
If it makes you feel any better.
If it means that much to you.
If it weren't for you, I would've given up long ago.
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have made this.
If it weren't for you, he might be dead right now.
If it works, I won't forget you.
If it works, you'll be the first one to know.
If it's OK with you, I'd like to go to the Indian restaurant.
If it's any consolation, I'm not happy about it either.
If memory serves, ...
If my memory serves me right, ...
If only I could help you.
If that's the way you want it.
If there's anything I can do, anything at all, just say the word.
If there's anything I can do, anything at all, please don't hesitate to ask.
If there's anything I can do, anything at all, please let me know.
If this doesn't work, nothing will.
If you change your mind, give me a call.
If you change your mind, let me know.
If you change your mind, you have my number.
If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
If you don't want me to go, I won't go.
If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't be here.
If you know what I mean.
If you like, we can…
If you need a shoulder to cry on, I've got two right here.
If you say so.
If you think about it, it pretty much explains everything.
If you think you can do it faster, you've got another think coming.
If you want me to elaborate on anything or have any questions, feel free to  ...
Imagine your worst nightmare and then multiply it...
In case you wondered...
In fact, I think you'll find it quite pleasurable.
In general, ...
In hindsight, I should have seen it coming, but...
In short, ...
In the past, I've had trouble letting someone else call the shots. Giving up control made me crazy.
Is it a coincidence?
Is it going to rain this weekend? Most likely.
Is it just me or is anyone else starving?
Is it just me or is it warm in here?
Is it something to do with me?
Is it too much to ask?
Is it worth it?
Is that awesome or what?
Is that great or what?
Is that so?
Is that what it is?
Is that what you mean?
Is that what you're telling me?
Is there any chance you might be mistaken?
Is there anything I can do?
It all comes down to chance.
It could be worse.
It could've been done ...
It could've been worse.
It dawned on me over time.
It depends on how it affects the individual.
It depends on what it involves.
It depends on what you are planning to do.
It depends on what you want.
It depends on what you're trying to do.
It depends on your definition of "okay".
It didn't even occur to me.
It didn't occur to me.
It doesn't count.
It doesn't have to be like that.
It doesn't have to be that way.
It doesn't have to be this way.
It doesn't make any difference.
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't make it hurt any less.
It doesn't matter to me.
It doesn't really matter.
It doesn't seem right.
It doesn't seem to get me anywhere.
It gives this little hits of dopamine each time, it's very very nice.
It goes without saying that...
It happened not too long ago.
It has been proven that ...
It has nothing to do with confidence.
It has nothing to do with you.
It has to stop.
It has your name on it.
It is a big deal.
It is believed that...
It is considered that...
It is expected that...
It is lovely weather today, isn't it?
It is of the utmost importance...
It is said that...
It just goes to show that...
It just goes to show...
It looks as if...
It looks like...
It makes perfect sense to me.
It matters not.
It may backfire on you.
It means a lot to me.
It might have been a bad idea.
It must have been difficult.
It must have been important.
It must have been tough.
It must have slipped my mind.
It never occurred to me it could actually be true.
It occurred to me that...
It occurs to me that...
It seems like...
It serves you right.
It shouldn't come as a surprise...
It slipped my mind.
It sounds like...
It sucks but it happens.
It suits you.
It took me a long time to find you.
It took me a long time to get used to their new boss.
It took me a long time to realize that.
It took me a while to...
It turned out to be a huge mistake.
It turns out...
It was a long time ago.
It was all for nothing.
It was bananas!
It was bound to happen.
It was great to hear from you again.
It was just a...
It was right after...
It was so kind of you to invite me to stay with you.
It was so nice of you to come all the way down to the airport to pick me up.
It wasn't meant to be.
It will take a few hours.
It won't happen again.
It won't solve the problem.
It would be nice if it stopped raining.
It would be nice if she came for a visit.
It would be nice if you helped me a little.
It would be nice if...
It would have been easier if...
It would've been better if you hadn't come.

It's a long story.
It's a matter of life and death.
It's a must.
It's a mystery I have yet to solve.
It's a no-brainer.
It's a pleasure to meet you. No, the pleasure is mine.
It's a shame to interrupt you.
It's about time...
It's ages since I've heard from you. I hope you're well.
It's all Greek to me
It's all hearsay.
It's all my fault.
It's an honor to meet you. No, the honor is mine.
It's bearable.
It's beautiful out there.

It's been nine days since my last drink.
It's been so long since I talked to anyone.
It's by way of an apology for my recent behavior.
It's close.
It's complicated.
It's driving me bananas.
It's driving me crazy.
It's easier said than done.
It's easy for you to say.

It's gonna be a long day.
It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be easy.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna blow your mind. I've got such good news.
It's good to see you.

It's got something to do with clouds.
It's gross!
It's hard to let go.
It's hard to say.
It's hard to tell.
It's hard to watch.
It's high time...
It's important to ...
It's just a figment of your imagination.

It's just gotten worse.
It's just not my thing.
It's just plain wrong.
It's just that ...
It's just that...
It's just the way it is.
It's kinda like a nightmare.
It's mandatory.
It's more than I can take.
It's my duty to remind you of something.

It's my fault.
It's never gonna happen.
It's nice to have parents around
It's nice to meet you.
It's no big deal.
It's no coincidence.
It's no use complaining about it.
It's no wonder that ...
It's none of your business.
It's not a big deal.
It's not about the money. It's about solving a problem. It's what I like to do, it's what I'm trained to do. It's who I am.
It's not all roses.
It's not an option.
It's not as easy as it looks.
It's not fair.
It's not feasible.

It's not that easy.
It's not that hard to figure out.
It's not up to you.
It's okay if you...
It's okay to...
It's on the tip of my tongue.
It's one thing to say something, but it's quite another to do something.
It's only a matter of time.
It's painful, but it's bearable.
It's quite simple, actually.
It's really hard for me to say.

Look on the bright side.
Looks like it's right up my alley.
Magic is about to happen.
Make it snappy.
Mark my words, there's going to be trouble.
Mark my words, you're gonna regret this.
Maybe it's for the best.
Maybe this is a good thing.
Maybe you could…?
Mind you, I'm not suggesting it.
More often than not, this is a challenge.
Most likely it was some kind of accident.
My concern is...
My duty was to fetch the lad here.
My hands are tied.
Never mind.
No clue.
No one's ever been so nice to me.
No reason in particular.
No shit.
No trouble at all.
No wonder I don't feel full.
No worries.
Not my cup of tea.
Not to worry.
Nothing in particular.
Nothing is impossible.
Nothing's gonna happen to you.
Now I have to suffer the consequences.
Now I know I made mistake.
Now that ..., it's time to ...
Now that you mention it, I do remember.
Now that you mention it, I remember one thing.
Now, if you'll excuse me,...
Of course. That's right up my alley.
Off the record, ...
Oh my goodness!
Oh, and another thing... This is just to let you know that...
Oh, well, that's okay.

Please don't be mad at me.
Please refrain from smoking here.
Please refrain from smoking in public places.
Pull your head out of your ass and stop drinking.
Pull yourself together.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
Repetition is the mother of skill.
Rest assured.
Roll with it.
Rumor has it you're in charge.
Rumor has it you're the one in charge here.
Scoff if you want, but...
See you soon.
Shit happens.
Should you need any help, just let me know.

So be it.
So far so good.
So many things could've gone wrong.
Someone needs to stop him.
Someone needs to teach me how to use this thing.
Someone needs to teach you how to share.
Something doesn't add up.
Sorry to hear about…
Sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you slow down a bit?
Sorry, I don't understand. Could you explain what you mean?
Sorry, I miss that. Could you say it again?
Sorry. Could you repeat a little louder?
Sorry. Could you repeat the question?
Sorry. Could you said that again?
Sorry. Could you slow down, please?
Sorry. I didn't catch that. Would you mind speaking more slowly?
Sorry. I didn't catch that. Would you mind speaking slower?
Sorry. I didn't hear you.
Sorry. What?
Sounds good to me.
Sounds like a plan. Let's roll.
Speaking of which, I should get going.
Speaking of which, it's not the worst idea.
Speaking of which, let's get a drink.
Stay away from me.
Take a deep breath.
Take a look around.
Take a look at it.
Take a look at that.
Take a look at this.
Take care of yourself.
Take it easy.
Take it from me, there's always a way.
Take it from me, you can't do that.
Take it from me, you really don't want it.
Take it with a grain of salt.
Take my word for it.
Take your time.
Tell me about it.
Thank you for inviting me to… but I"m afraid I won't be able to…

Thanks, but I'm on duty.
That can't be right.
That doesn't sound right.
That should do it. Этого должно хватить.
That should do the trick.
That sort of thing.
That sounds like a great idea.
That sucks.
That was a mistake.
That was hard to watch.
That's a far cry from reality, to say the least.
That's a good question.
That's a little steep.
That's a load of crap.
That's a remarkable achievement.
That's easy for you to say.
That's it. I can't take it anymore.
That's more like it.
That's much better.
That's my story in a nutshell.
That's not much of a plan.
That's pretty much it.
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
That's the whole point.
That's true.
That's very flattering.
That's very kind of you to say.
That's what I said.
That's what I thought - Я тоже так думал/подумал
That's why I ...
The answer lies within each of us.
The early bird gets the worm.
The last thing I wanted to do was let you down.
The reason I came over is because I respect you.
The reason I came over is to tell you...
The ship has sailed.
The way I see it, we have no choice.
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.
Then it dawned on me that I was going to have to face this all by myself.
There are a lot of reasons why this won't work.
There are a lot of things I don't know.
There are a lot of things that I can't explain.
There are a lot of ways to die.
There are no coincidences.
There is no silver bullet.
There is no way to avoid it.
There is no way to get around it.
There isn't much time
There must be some mistake.
There was this one time...
There's a lot at stake here.
There's no doubt about it.
There's no need to...
There's no point in...
There's no question about that.
There's no short cuts, trust me.
There's no telling...
There's nothing I can do.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you.
Think it over.
This conversation is over.
This is all wrong.
This is an important moment, and I want to savor it.
This is embarrassing.
This is gonna be a lot of fun.
This is how it looks like in practice.
This is insane.
This is mean - Это подло
This is not about you.
This is ridiculous.
This is supposed to be fun.
This is the first time I've ever felt so nervous.
This is the first time I've heard of it.
This is the first time I've managed to make it.
This is the first time you're lying to me.
This is the long way of saying yes.
This is the worst thing you've ever done, and I'll never forgive you.
This was grueling work.
To get started, ...
To make a long story short, ...
To make a long story short, I didn't meet anyone special.
Tread lightly.
Very impressive.
Wait a minute, ...
Watch your mouth.
Watch your step.
We don't need to...
We have a lot in common.
We make a great team.
We were just talking about...
We're all done for now.
We're all done here.
We're all done.
We're all gonna die!
We're all set.
We've met before once or twice.
Well, it's about time.

Whatever is to be will be.
When I need your help, I will ask for it.
When I was a kid, I used to swim in that river.
When I was growing up...
When did this happen?
When it comes to babies, women are crazy.
When it comes to food, I have certain rules.
When it comes to politics, I know nothing.
When it comes to women, I do everything wrong.
When it comes to...
When you're done with that, can you look at this?
Where are you going to?
Where did that come from?
Where did you hear that? From a very reliable friend.
Where have you been?
Where the hell have you been?
Where the hell have you benn?
Where were we?
Which brings up an interesting question.
Which way is right?
Who am I kidding?
Who are you and where are you from?
Who are you talking to?
Who are you to judge me?
Who are you to question me?
Who do you think you are?
Who would've thought?
Why are you so mad?
Why did I ever let you go?
Why did you put up with it?
Why didn't you say something?
Why didn't you tell me...?
Why didn't you tell me?
Why do I have to...?
Why don't we just call it a day right now?
Why don't you just go...
Why don't you just...
Why don't you...?
Why don't you…?
Why have you brought me here?
Why have you never told me this?
Why in the world would I do that?
Why on earth would I do that?
Why should I help you out?
Why should I?
Why the long faces?
Why would you do that?
Why would you do this?
Why would you say that?
Why would you want to do that?
Will we have the cat back by friday?
With all due respect, I can't share this view.
With respect, you don't quite seem to understand.
Worry not.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Would it be okay if I asked out your sister?
Would it be okay if I give you a hug?
Would it be okay if I work from home today?
Would it be okay if we postpone this for a little while?
Would it be possible...?
Would you care to join me for lunch?
Would you knock it off?
Would you like to go...?
Would you like to have...?
Would you relax?
Would you stop?
Would you wanna do that?
You ain't gonna need it.
You and I are gonna...
You are never gonna believe who's here.
You are not gonna believe...
You can be mad at me all you want, but I'm not giving up on you.
You can count on me.
You can rely on me.
You can rest assured.
You can say that again.
You can take my word for it.
You can't be serious.
You can't compare apples to oranges.
You can't go wrong with something traditional.
You catch on quickly.
You could say that.
You couldn't have seen it coming.
You did great.
You didn't happen to bring any food with you, did you?
You don't call the shots.
You don't have the guts.
You don't have to be afraid.
You don't have to be nervous.
You don't have to do that.
You don't have to do this.
You don't have to tell me.
You don't have to worry about it anymore.
You don't have to worry about that.
You don't say.
You get the idea.
You had better ask him in advance how much it will cost.
You had better make use of this opportunity.
You have no idea what I can handle.
You have no idea what I'm capable of.
You have to help me.
You know what I mean.
You know what I was thinking.
You know what I'm gonna do.
You know what we should do.
You know what's about to happen.
You know what, forget it.
You look fantastic!
You made my day.
You might have noticed...
You must've been so scared.
You nailed it.
You owe me an answer.
You rock. You're awesome. - Ты крут!
You seem testy this morning.
You should be proud of yourself.
You smell so good!
You snooze, you lose, dude.
You wanna bet agains me?
You will not regret this.
You would have liked him.
You wouldn't believe.
You wouldn't dare.
You'd better hurry up.
You'll make it.
You'll never believe what…
You'll never guess what just happened.
You'll never guess who I just found online.
You're bound to...
You're comparing apples to oranges.
You're completely right.
You're dead right.
You're getting on my nerves.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna have to...
You're just gonna have to...
You're not gonna believe this.
You're on the right track.
You're treading on very thin ice.
You're welcome.
You've been selected to take part in a random survey...
You've done a pretty good.
You've done nothing wrong.
You've got nerves of steel.
You've got to be kidding me.
You've just missed him.
You've just read my mind.
